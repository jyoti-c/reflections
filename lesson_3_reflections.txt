When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans: When i want my file to be made public I would make it remote tha local so that it is easily accessible from anywhere 
just by providing  a link which could be useful when working in group projects so that the other memebers are aware of the
commits that I have made into the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans: One might want a group of changes to be made on the local repository rather than having each commit to be pulled automatically to the local one . 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Ans:Fork is used to create a copy of the fileon the github database .
    Clone will creare a copy on user database
    Branches are used for naming the commits so it is easily verified ny the user what the last commit was by the use of name of branch instead of commit id.
